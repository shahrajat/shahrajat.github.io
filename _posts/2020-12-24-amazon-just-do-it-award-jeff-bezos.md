## College years
Back in my sophomore year in undergrad, I got obsessed with doing Software projects unrelated to my coursework. It all started when I was selected in my batch to build the complete website for my college's annual business and management festival called Consortium. Here is the [Wayback machine's snapshot](https://web.archive.org/web/20120315191008/http://www.consortiumvnit.com/index.php) of what is looked like (some of the components no longer work now that most browsers no longer support flash). C and Data Structure coursework in my freshman years had completely put me off and got me disinterested in learning programming (blame the super theoretical teaching methods?). Learning to build websites with JS, PHP, and MySQL in a team gave me much-needed confidence and introduced me to full-stack development. More importantly, I lacked formal awareness of the Software development lifecycle and the challenges of collaborating on team projects which surprisingly made it more fun. I still chuckle imagining how we used to share code among ourselves as zip files, as nobody told us what Git was. To date, nothing beats the thrill of deploying untested, unreviewed duct tape of several JQuery plugins and hacky PHP MySQL code to phpMyAdmin. 

Throughout my undergrad, I built enough websites to become the goto person for full-stack development in college - such as the one for our annual technical fest ([Wayback snapshot](https://web.archive.org/web/20130115195228/http://axisvnit.org/)), very large-scale coding challenges with database scaling challenges, and even led a team of 10+ batchmates to successfully launch a social media platform for our college that supported live chats, video calls, feed and more, written mostly from scratch - well The Social Network movie had its global impact after all. Failed enough times as well that it deserves another post. The skills and experience through these projects came very handy during campus job placements as well! 
By doing these projects, I learned several key things early in my career:
* Software development is a broad field, and building a passion for at least one niche area is critical.
* Start with prototyping and hacking together things early on to validate a new idea.
* Building a simple, intuitive user experience is hard, but critical for your product.
* Rapid software development while working in a team is equally challenging and fun.

I completed my undergrad equipped with enough skills to build useful mid-scale software and with a dream of having my own start-up one day. Along the way, I did a formal Master's as well at [NC State](https://ncsu.edu/) to get some specialization in Machine Learning, given all the craze around it.

## Amazon Days
Right after graduation, I joined Amazon at its Seattle HQ, when it had around 500,000 employees worldwide. I considered myself very fortunate to be part of the biggest e-commerce website in the world, and I worked on unique challengesâ€” all revolved around the common theme of doing things at scale. The public perception of Amazon makes it sound as if the 9-5 job leaves you with no energy for personal learning and growth, and I thought the entrepreneurship dreams would need to be put on the back burner. I enjoyed working on 

## Just Do It Award

Within a few months, I attended my first company-wide all-hands in person at the now-called Climate Pledge Arena, where at the end of the all-hands, Jeff Bezos handed over a "Just Do It" award to an employee for showing bias for action and innovation by doing something not part of their job. I was elated to see how the company still has so many avenues to innovate and be recognized at a global level by Jeff Bezos despite the size of the company. 

What does a company this big lack where I can independently innovate outside of my regular work (though that was equally exciting)? The question kept me occupied for months. Having failed couple of times in the past, and knowing I   

Finally, in Oct 2020, I was awarded the coveted "Just Do It" award by Jeff Bezos, Founder and CEO of Amazon, in the company-wide All Hands meeting. Every year this award recognizes select few employees who exemplify two of our core values: innovation and bias for action by creating an impact on their own outside of their day job.

My intrapreneurship effort over the last 3 years in creating the platform "Amazon Gather" has been incredibly useful to several thousand Amazonians for exploring interesting virtual events and meet like minded people. In the wake of COVID-19, this has helped people connect virtually and feel secure. It is humbling to see my brainchild, which I started as a side-project materialize into a global team of engineers taking it to the next level.

Joining a huge corporation like Amazon as a fresh grad could be overwhelming at times but I followed by personal mantra of "don't wait, just innovate" and identified a key area where I can make an impact. Amazon's culture provided me with the wings and the resources to shape this idea into the product it is today. Based on my personal experience, I encourage new grads to keep innovating and with perseverance I'm sure it will be a rewarding journey.
