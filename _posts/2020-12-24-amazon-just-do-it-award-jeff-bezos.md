Back in my sophomore year in undergrad, I got obsessed with doing Software projects unrelated to my coursework. That helped to get my first internship (paid!) at IIT Bombay. 

Finally in Oct 2020, I was awarded the coveted "Just Do It" award by Jeff Bezos, Founder and CEO of Amazon in the company-wide All Hands meeting. Every year this award recognizes select few employees who exemplify two of our core values: innovation and bias for action by creating an impact on their own outside of their day job.

My intrapreneurship effort over the last 3 years in creating the platform "Amazon Gather" has been incredibly useful to several thousand Amazonians for exploring interesting virtual events and meet like minded people. In the wake of COVID-19, this has helped people connect virtually and feel secure. It is humbling to see my brainchild, which I started as a side-project materialize into a global team of engineers taking it to the next level.

Joining a huge corporation like Amazon as a fresh grad could be overwhelming at times but I followed by personal mantra of "don't wait, just innovate" and identified a key area where I can make an impact. Amazon's culture provided me with the wings and the resources to shape this idea into the product it is today. Based on my personal experience, I encourage new grads to keep innovating and with perseverance I'm sure it will be a rewarding journey.
