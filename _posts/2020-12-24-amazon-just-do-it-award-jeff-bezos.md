Back in my sophomore year in undergrad, I got obsessed with doing Software projects unrelated to my coursework. It all started when I was selected in my batch to build the complete website for my college's business and management festival called Consortium. Here is the [Wayback machine's snapshot](https://web.archive.org/web/20120315191008/http://www.consortiumvnit.com/index.php) of what is looked like (some of the components no longer work now that most browsers no longer support flash). C and Data Structure coursework in my freshman years had completely put me off and got me disinterested in learning programming (blame the super theoretical teaching methods?). Learning to build websites with JS, PHP, and MySQL in a team gave me much-needed confidence and introduced me to full-stack development. More importantly, I lacked formal awareness of the Software development lifecycle and the challenges of collaborating on team projects which surprisingly made it more fun. I still chuckle imagining how we used to share code among ourselves as zip files, as nobody told us what Git was. To date, nothing beats the thrill of deploying untested, unreviewed duct tape of several JQuery plugins and hacky PHP MySQL code to phpMyAdmin.

Finally, in Oct 2020, I was awarded the coveted "Just Do It" award by Jeff Bezos, Founder and CEO of Amazon, in the company-wide All Hands meeting. Every year this award recognizes select few employees who exemplify two of our core values: innovation and bias for action by creating an impact on their own outside of their day job.

My intrapreneurship effort over the last 3 years in creating the platform "Amazon Gather" has been incredibly useful to several thousand Amazonians for exploring interesting virtual events and meet like minded people. In the wake of COVID-19, this has helped people connect virtually and feel secure. It is humbling to see my brainchild, which I started as a side-project materialize into a global team of engineers taking it to the next level.

Joining a huge corporation like Amazon as a fresh grad could be overwhelming at times but I followed by personal mantra of "don't wait, just innovate" and identified a key area where I can make an impact. Amazon's culture provided me with the wings and the resources to shape this idea into the product it is today. Based on my personal experience, I encourage new grads to keep innovating and with perseverance I'm sure it will be a rewarding journey.
